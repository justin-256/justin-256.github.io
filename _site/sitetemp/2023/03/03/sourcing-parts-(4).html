    <p>I can never have enough parts. I often prefer to have parts on hand rather than having to order them online and have the project sit until some company ships the required bits to me. There are companies like Mouser and Digikey who have really fast shipping (at least where I am), but prices can sometimes be quite high and for just a couple parts needed to finish a project, it can be hard to reach the threshold for free shipping. That’s why I like to keep a large stock of components, all ready for when I need them. Here I will present some of the places I have purchased from, and give my thoughts.</p>

<p>Before we get started, please note that everything here is from my point of view and experience, you may have a different opinion or experience with these companies. Here in Canada shipping from the United States can sometimes be expensive and take a long time.</p>

<h3 id="digikey">Digikey</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Pros:</li>
</ul>

<p>Great selection, fast delivery. All parts are high quality and often well labeled. The search engine is easy to use and intuitive. The packaging is REALLY good, always anti static.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cons:</li>
</ul>

<p>Can be quite expensive, and the threshold (at least in Canada) for free shipping is high. For a couple parts, the shipping can be far more than the actual component value.</p>

<h3 id="mouser">Mouser</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Pros:</li>
</ul>

<p>Great selection and sometimes slightly lower cost than Digikey. Fast delivery.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cons:</li>
</ul>

<p>Packaging not as good as digikey</p>

<h3 id="lcsc">LCSC</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Pros:</li>
</ul>

<p>Cheap due to their proximity to Chinese manufacturers. Decent selection.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cons:</li>
</ul>

<p>Chinese data laws. Sells some dubious components (Bourns knockoff BOCHEN). Fairly small selection compared to Digikey and Mouser</p>

<h3 id="ebay-same-for-amazon">Ebay (Same for Amazon)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Pros:</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find some really obscure and unique stuff, for some parts it is really cheap. Shipping can be really low, and sometimes free!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cons:</li>
</ul>

<p>Often poor quality, slow shipping and sometimes fake/re-topped chips. As a rule of thumb, if it is new, an old chip and is coming from China, it is probably fake. (Not always the case, but sadly most of the time.)</p>

<h3 id="aliexpress">Aliexpress</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Pros</li>
</ul>

<p>Straight from the horses mouth. Often really cheap.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cons</li>
</ul>

<p>Questionable quality. Slow shipping (sometimes a few MONTHS!?). Chinese data laws and some cases of people being asked for ID makes this less appealing for me.</p>

<h2 id="smaller-companies">Smaller companies</h2>

<h3 id="electronic-goldmine">Electronic Goldmine</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Pros</li>
</ul>

<p>I love this place. They buy out old stock from manufacturers and companies going out of business or who have some parts that would otherwise go to the garbage and resell them for a profit. Despite this the prices are still incredibly low. It has the same feel as the diminishing and rare electronics surplus stores, and you never know what you will find. They have constant sales, so it can be worth subscribing to their weekly newsletter. One of the best parts has to be the assortments/surprise boxes. These are probably the floor sweepings, but packed in the cardboard boxes are tons of random (or categorized, in the case of assortments) parts. They are almost always major brands, and retail for much more than what you pay. Great for stocking up.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cons</li>
</ul>

<p>Shipping to Canada is HIGH, still sometimes worth the price but can be quite shocking, especially $50 fines at the door. Some parts that should be packaged in antistatic material are not, but I have never had any noticeable issues. Due to the parts often being quite old, many have lead present which may be off putting to some people, or those who wish to stay compliant to ROHS. Some of the bulk deals may have a lit of less useful parts. I bought a box of diodes, and the majority were zeners, sometimes high voltage ones. Useful, but I would prefer more standard diodes.</p>

<h3 id="radio-741">Radio 741</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Pros</li>
</ul>

<p>What a name. They have some seriously interesting and hard to find parts. I only ever bought some older components from them, but they came well packaged in some of the softest and nicest feeling antistatic foam I have ever seen, inside a static shielding bag.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cons</li>
</ul>

<p>Being situated in Greece, the shipping may be expensive. While the selection is good and there are some hard to find parts, they are priced accordingly. Still worth a look if you are out of luck elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="infinite-cables">Infinite Cables</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Pros</li>
</ul>

<p>Great quality and prices. I bought some CAT6 cable, tools and wall sockets for cable runs, but if you are into RF or radio they have coax as well. They are based in Ontario, Canada and have great customer service and cheap/fast shipping (I found a forum form 2008 with a coupon code that STILL WORKS as of writing this: <a href="https://forums.redflagdeals.com/infinitecables-com-10-off-coupon-1040822/">https://forums.redflagdeals.com/infinitecables-com-10-off-coupon-1040822/</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Cons</li>
</ul>

<p>Honestly, I don’t really have anything bad to say about them. They sell quality cables for decent prices, and their shipping was not bad. Check them out if you plan on running some ethernet and you are located in Canada!</p>

<h2 id="salvaging">Salvaging</h2>

<p>This is one of my favorite sources. I prefer old (around 80s to 90s) industrial or professional equipment that does not have much of any other use, such as the central office service analyzer I tore apart previously. These contain many hard to find or expensive parts that can be desoldered and reused for projects.</p>

<h2 id="samples">Samples</h2>

<p>If you are looking for a small quantity of free parts, look into samples. Do not abuse it, make sure the company still profits off you by buying some other stuff. They are doing you a favor, pay it back. Please note that you will need a company or something because these samples are aimed at companies.</p>
