    <p>I required an inductor that had a fairly low inductance, but would be large if I wound it as an air core inductor. To increase inductance and reduce size, inductors are often wound around a ferrite material. In this case, I chose a ferrite bead I salvaged from a device a little while ago. It is likely the same or similar to Fair-Rite part “2773001112”, and is listed on DigiKey for $0.18 CAD as of August 2022: <a href="https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/fair-rite-products-corp/2773001112/8594241">https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/fair-rite-products-corp/2773001112/8594241</a></p>

<h3 id="step-1-removing-wire">Step 1: Removing Wire</h3>
<p>These ferrites have a wire that is glued inside, so heat must be used to losen it. This process would be easier on a new ferrite with straight leads. I used my soldering iron to heat the wire, and then pliers to gently pull it out. Take care when doing this as ferrite is very delicate and will shatter.</p>

<p>After the wire was removed, I needed to remove excess glue remaining inside. I used a small drill bit for this mounted in a pin vise. A pin vise is like a precision screwdriver with a chuck to accept drill bits, and using one avoids snapping a small bit or damaging the ferrite. I used two bits to gradually enlarge the hole and eventually remove all the glue.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-fitting-the-leads">Step 2: Fitting the leads</h3>

<p>If you used a new ferrite, you could save the wire. Since mine was quite short, I chose to use the leads from a diode. They fit well in the holes, and with some glue they could be mounted securely. I scored a small mark in them so I would know how far to insert them without having them touch creating a short.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/preview/ferrite-inductor-3.jpg" alt="Making new leads" /></p>

<p>I used standard CA type superglue to secure them. I suggest using a more heat resistant glue, as the glue I used became soft when the leads were heated for too long.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-winding">Step 3: Winding</h3>

<p>Now it is time to make the turns on the core. I used 30 AWG enameled copper wire from an old electromagnet. I have found that they rarely have lacquer securing the windings, so they are like little bobbins of easily reusable wire. After tinning an end, I wrapped it around one of the inductor leads. Mounting the inductor in my drill helped with the winding process. I glued the wire to the core so that the windings could be made easily. I experimented with different numbers of turns before so I knew how many to make.</p>

<p>Before soldering the other side I suggest leaving a length of wire and testing it, that way if you need to add a turn you have some wire left to do so. After winding, tinning the other end and wrapping it around the second lead to secure it, I spun it on my drill while applying a layer of glue to secure the windings. Here is the final result, before I soldered the other end. It looks quite good, and seems to work quite well for my oscillator application.</p>
