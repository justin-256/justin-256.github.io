Around a month ago when browsing ebay for test equipment, I found a strange device. After seeing the price, I figured I would look into it. After seeing a shipping cost of $120, I started to reconsider the thought of buying it. After looking it up I found no  info on it other than the listing itself. It was a big unit made by Northern Telecom, a once very common company that is now shut down due to a number of reasons. I am really interested in the company, it could be their fate  or the fact that it was a big Canadian company, but I knew I had to have it.

Because of the fact that it says “central office” and “Northern Telecom” in the title, I knew I had no use for such a special piece of equipment. However, curiosity got the best of me and I wanted to take it apart and see what was inside and maybe even get some useful parts from it that I could use in future projects. I wanted to first know if what was inside was worth the money. I figured I could get an approximation by knowing the weight. After contacting the seller asking for the weight and after them responding 45 pounds, I came to three conclusions:

1. It's full of rocks
2. There is a lot of metal
3. It's full of parts

I decided to take the chance and ordered it. Around a week and a half later, the day before leaving to go on vacation, I got a massive box in the mail.

That's one big box!

I opened it up and after removing many pieces of packing material I got to the beast. Besides the dirt and a few rusty screws, it was gorgeous! Metal knobs, sturdy enclosure, beautiful buttons and potentiometers that felt amazing to turn.

I immediately got out my screwdrivers and took the lid off. What I saw next was exactly what I was hoping to see. Many cards with edge connectors. All numbered. Big relays. A massive Mallory capacitor bolted to the side. I didn't know where to start, so I started looking at the cards. I tried cards 4 and 5, but they wouldn't budge. But the others came out. Towards the end I pulled out a card with a battery, and considering the age of the product I knew it would be leaky. But I didn't expect colourful crystals!

So many cards!

What the hell happened here!?

After somehow getting it upstairs WITHOUT breaking my back, I started to take it apart. I don't have any pictures as I was so excited. However after I got back from vacation I started to document all the boards. I took pictures of both sides. Here they are: (the end has the original listing images)
